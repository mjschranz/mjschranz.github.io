  This one's going to be short and sweet but I wanted to share a quick thing I've learned about that's made my life
  running numerous apps from the terminal much easier. I'm going to call it <strong>search through your command history</strong>.
  It's pretty awesome.

  Basically, hit <strong>CTRL + R</strong> (at least on a Mac, using the stock Terminal app with Bash) and you can just start typing
  the name of the command you are searching for. It will auto populate it with a matching command and you can just hit enter to run it!
